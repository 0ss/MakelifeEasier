Right now I just added some basic silly commands ðŸ˜Ž


I'm planning an'shalah to add more commands and document them.

How to use those commands ?
*you need to install `make` command in your machine*

- Windows
`choco install make`

- Ubunto
`sudo apt-get -y install make`

Then, add the Makefile file in your project root dir and have fun!
